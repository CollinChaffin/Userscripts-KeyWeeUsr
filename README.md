# Userscripts
Welcome to my small script collection, I hope you'll find it useful. :) Userscripts for google services are updated as soon as I find something missing/wrong and fix it. I don't spend 24/7 using only these things, however, so if there's something wrong and no mention in readme or directly in script, notify me(mail/issue/...).
## How to install
You'll need an extension for your browser to use these scripts.
##### Prerequisites
- [Tampermonkey(Chrome)](https://tampermonkey.net)
- [Greasemonkey(Firefox)](http://www.greasespot.net)
- [Violent monkey(Opera)](https://addons.opera.com/sk/extensions/details/violent-monkey/)
- [Greasemonkey Port(SeaMonkey)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmport/)

##### Installation
###### GitHub
- Navigate to the script(<code>*.user.js</code>) you want to install in the repository
- Click on the <code>Raw</code> button! The extension will recognize <code>*.user.js</code> file.
- Install it!

###### Other sites

Congratulations, now you can use the script!

## Gallery
##### Nighty-night Google Docs
A dark Lightroom/Photoshop CS6-like theme for Google Docs. Almost everything is adjusted to working at night. Say no more to those white eye-burning pages!
